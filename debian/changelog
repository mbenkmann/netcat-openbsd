netcat-openbsd (1.89-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quit immediately after EOF if -q is not given (i.e. make the default
    equivalent to -q 0). This is the standard upstream behavior and what
    other Linux distributions use. It is different from netcat-traditional,
    but compatibility with other versions of OpenBSD netcat is more
    important. (Closes: #502188)

netcat-openbsd (1.89-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Silence -z flag, for compatibility with netcat-traditional (Closes:
    #464564)
  * Move stray line in socks.c to quilt patch series (Closes: #485160)
  * Add missing documentation for -q option to man page.

netcat-openbsd (1.89-2) unstable; urgency=low

netcat-openbsd (1.89-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #145798)
  * Includes support for:
    - IPv6 (Closes: #461317)
    - Unix domain sockets (Closes: #348564)
    - SOCKS (Closes: #142898)
  * Conflict with netcat versions older than netcat-traditional, so that we
    can use alternatives.
  * Port some features over from netcat-traditional:
    - Exit successfully when printing help text (-h), and include the Debian
      revision.
    - Add the -q (quit on standard input EOF) flag.
    - Add support for specifying ports by name (/etc/services). Unlike the
      old hack for this, nc will first try to find a named service, then fall
      back to numeric parsing, so no escaping is needed.
